# useEffect in React 

## What's useEffect ? 

In React's functional components, `useEffect` is a Hook that allows us to perform side effects like
* Fetching data. 
* Subscribing to events. 
* Manipulating the DOM. 

`useEffect` is the functional component equivalent of the lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate` and `componentWillUnmount` in class components. 


## Dependency Array in useEffect 
The second parameter of `useEffect` is the **dependency array** , which controls when the effect runs: 

### Empty dependency array([]):
- The effect runs **only once**, after the component is first rendered and mounted. 
- This mimics the behavior of `componentDidMount()` in class component. 
### No dependency array: 
- The effect runs after **every render**, which includes both initial and subsequent renders. 
- This can lead to redundant or infinite calls (like an API request being triggered multiple times unnecessarily).
### Dependency array with values (e.g., [prop1, prop2]): 
- The effect runs only when the specified dependencies change.
