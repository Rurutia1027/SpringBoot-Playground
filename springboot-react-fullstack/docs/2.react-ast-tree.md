# React's Render and AST Tree 

## My understanding is: 
I found something interesting and help me easy to understand the React's components, their(components) relationship with HTML's DOM, their render action and their lifetime.
Let me write those down. As I previously learned the structure of grammar tree especially for SQL, I can understand components as follows:

The initial render is the first time a component (for the entire React application) is displayed on the web page. 
It is like extending from the root to the leaves of the tree nodes. This means that the first time the tree loads, 
it puts the root node and the core nodes into the cache/memory, which is the process of the initial render(render is the process components converted/transformed into the DOM element of a HTML which gonna displayed on the page for webpage vierwers).

In subsequent renders, if we redirect to some sub-pages, what happen of the React Applicaiton:  
1. Load those sub-nodes into memory -> empty but space allocated.
2. Integrate the empty data structures on sub-tree nodes with the backend returned data values. 
3. Integrate the data + empty nodes to create && initialize a complete component.
4. Convert the integrated component into a DOM element to be shown on the web page.

## GPT Help Refined Description Version
Even though it is not complete correct, but it really helps me understand React Components. So I let GPT help me refine the description and fix some errors of the description above. 

As we introduced in previous notes, there are mainly two types of render:  **Initial Render**, **Re-render**.  

### Initial Render as Tree Construction 
* The **root node** represents the **root React component** (e.g., `<App/>`) in our React application.
* The **child nodes** (or sub-nodes) represent the child components that `<App/>` includes, either directly or indirectly. 
* During the **initial render**, React recursively constructs the tree of components starting from the root and going down to the leaves(the smallest pieces of the UI).

**Here's how it aligns**:
#### Root Node (React App)
* React starts rendering from the root component (like the grammar tree starts from the top-most root node). 

#### Expand Child Nodes(Child Components)
* The root component declares child components, which are rendered recursively.
* These child components can declare further child components, creating a tree-like structure in memory. 

#### Leaves(Final UI Elements)
* The leaves are the smallest elements (e.g., `<buttong/>`, `<div/>`, etc.) that React converts into actual DOM elements. 

### Re-renders as Subtree Updates 
When a React application **re-render**, it's like React revisiting a specific subtree of the tree: 
#### Loading Sub-nodes to Memory
* When we navigate to a new page or interact with a component, React starts loading the subtree corresponding to that part of the UI.
* For example, if you visit a new page, React renders the components for that page while leaving other components(outside this subtree) unchanged. 

#### Empty Data Structures
* The components initially load with empty or placeholder state (like an unpopulated tree structure). 
* For example: 
```javascript
const [data, setData] = useState(null); 
```

#### Integrate with Backend Data
* Once data is fetched (e.g., from a backend API via some javascript library), React populates these placeholders with actual values.
* This step is akin to filling in a node's attribute or values in a grammar tree after parsing the corresponding tokens. 

#### DOM Element Conversion
* The fully constructed component tree(with data) is then translated into **HTML DOM elements** and displayed on the page. 
* This is similar to resolving the grammar tree into final expressions or queries in SQL parsing.

## Types of Renders in React 

In React, there are primarily two types of renders: 

### Initial Render 
* This is the first time a React component is rendered to the DOM when the app is loaded. 
* It happens when the component (or the entire React) is mounted for the first time. 
* During this phase, React processes the component tree, creates the virtual DOM, compare it with the current DOM, and finally, updates the actual DOM to relfect the changes. 

### Re-render(or Update Render)
* This occurs when there is a change in the component's state or props, or when a parent component re-renders. 
* React will check if anything has changed(such as the state, props, or context), and if so, it will trigger a re-render. 
* Re-render allow the component to update its output in response to changes. This is the process when the component's state or props are update.

### Re-render Trigger Case 
- **State Updates**: Whenever you update the state using `setState()` or `useState()`, React triggers a re-render.  
- **Props Changes**: If a parent component updates its state or props, it will cause the child component to re-render. 
- **Context Changes**: If a component consumes a context and that context's value changes, the component will re-render. 
- **Local Updates**: This typically refers to re-rending a specific part of the UI(component) due to a local state update, which does not affect the rest of the application. React optimize this by only re-rendering the affected components(thanks to the virtual DOM and diffing algorithm).
