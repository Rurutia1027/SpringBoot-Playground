# Notes for Docker Network

In Docker, networking is a crucial aspect that allow containers to communicate with each other and with internal
systems.
Docker provides several types of networks, each serving different purposes. Here is a breakdown of the types of
networks, and commands shows how to create, and manage different types of networks.

## Types of Docker Networks 
Docker defines several types of networks, each designed for specific use cases: 

### Bridge Network
* Define Network: If no network is specified when starting a container. It(the setup container) is connected to the default bridge network.
* Use Case: Suitable for containers that need to communicate with each other on the same host. 
* Isolation: Provides isolation between containers on different bridge networks. 

### Host Network
* Direct Connection: Containers share the host's network stack. This means that they can use the host's IP address and ports directly.
* Use Case: Useful for performance-sensitives applications where you want to bypass Docker's network isolation.

### Overlay Network
* Multi-Host Communication: This allows containers running on different Docker hosts to communicate securely.
* Use Cases: Essential for deploying applications in Docker Swam or Kubernetes where services need to communicate across multiple hosts. 

### Macvlan Network
* Custom MAC Addresses: Assigns a unique MAC address to each container, making it appear as a physical device on the network.
* Use Case: Useful for applications that require direct access to the network layer, such as legacy applications that expect to see physical network interfaces. 

### None Network
* No Networking: Containers connected to this network have no network access. 
* Use Case: Useful for applications that do not require network connectivity.
