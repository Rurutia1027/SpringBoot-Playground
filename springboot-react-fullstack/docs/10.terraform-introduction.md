# Notes for Terraform

## What's Terraform ?

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool created by HashiCrop. It allows you to define and
provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language called **HCL**(HasiCorp Language). With Terraform, we
can manage cloud services, virtual machines, networking, and more in a consistent and repeatable manner.

## How Terraform Solves Problems in DevOps?

### Infrastructure Provision

- **Automated Setup**: Terraform automates the creation of infrastructure components like servers, databases, and
  networking. This reduces manual errors and speeds up deployment times.

- **Version Control**: By defining infrastructure in code, teams can track changes, roll back configurations, and
  collaborate effectively using version control systems like Git.

### Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Deployment

- **Cloud Agnostic**: Terraform can manage infrastructure across various cloud provides (AWS, Azure, GCP) and even
  on-premises environments. This flexibility allows SREs to avoid vendor lock-in and use the best services available.

### Resource Management

- **Lifetime Management**: Terraform keeps track of resource dependencies and can update or destroy resource safely
  without causing errors.
- **State Management**: It maintains a state file that reflects the current state of our infrastructure, allowing us to
  understand what resources are deployed and their corresponding configurations.

### Integration with Docker and Kubernetes

- **Container Orchestration**: Terraform can provision Kubernetes clusters and configure Docker containers, making it
  easier to manage containerized applications.
- **Environment Consistency**: By using Terraform alongside Kubernetes and Docker, we can ensure that the environments(
  deployment, staging, production) are consistent and easily reproducible.
