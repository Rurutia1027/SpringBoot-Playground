# Understanding Context, Props, and State in React

In previous note's Context, Context Value, Props, and States are frequently talked about. So in this note, I add more introductions and details of them in the scope of React.
In React, **Context**, **Props**, and **State** are **all** mechanisms for passing data around and managing the application's state, but they serve different purposes.
Understanding each of these concepts and how they interact with each other is the key to building React applications. 

## Context 
**Context** is a mechanism that allows us to pass data through the component tree without manually passing props at every level.
_(got it! it just like the SpringContext a global-cache-sharer of objects/data thread-safely)_. 
It is especially useful when we have global data that needs to be accessed by many components, such as theme settings, user authentication status, or language preferences. 

### Key Points of Context 
* **Context** allows global data sharing. 
* It can be accessed at any level in the component tree. 
* It is typically used for data that needs to be accessed by many components, like user authentication, themes, or language preferences. 

### Examples of Using Context 
```jsx
import React, {createContext, useContext, useState} from 'react'; 

// Create Context 
const ThemeContext = createContext('light'); 

function App() {
    const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light'); 
    
    return (
        <ThemeContext.Proiver value={theme}>
            <button onClick={() => {
                setTheme(theme=='light' ? 'dark' : 'light')}}>
                Toggle Theme
            </button>
            <Child/>
        </ThemeContext.Proiver>
    ); 
}

function Child(){
    return <Grandchild/>; 
}

function Grandchild() {
    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
    return <div>The current theme is:  {theme}</div>; 
}

export default App; 
```
* `ThemeContext.Provider` provides the current theme (light or dark) to all child components. 
* The `Grandchild` component uses `useContext` to access the current theme and display it.

## Props
**Props** (short for "properties") are a way of passing data from a parent component to a child component. 
They are immutable, meaning once a prop is passed into a component, it cannot be changed by that component. 
**Props** are used to configure or customize components and pass data down the component tree. 

### Key Points of Props:
* **Props** are read-only.(immutable!)
* They are passed to child components from parent components. 
* **Props** allow components to be dynamic and configurable. 

### Examples of using Props
```javascript
import React from 'react'; 

// The Parent component passes name and age as props to the Child component 
function Parent() {
    return <Child name="Hale" age={19} />; 
}


// The Child component accesses these props via props.name & props.age. 
function Child(props) {
    return (
        <div>
            <p>Name: {props.name}</p>
            <p>Age: {props.age}</p>
        </div>
    ); 
}

export default Parent; 
```

## State
**State** is a way for components to manage their own data that can change over time. State is mutable (it can be updated),
and when state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the new state. 
State is local to the component and is used to track information that can change during the lifecycle of the component, such as user input, button clicks, or API responses(is this means that we can add some listener in the scope of the listener to some actions based on different events are triggered? well.. this event is the so called the re-render and it can be invoked dynamically once react detects there is a change of the state).

### Key Points of State 
* **State** is mutable, meaning it can be updated. 
* It can only be used in class components(via `this.state`) or functional components(via the `useState` hook). 
* When the state changes, the component re-renders automatically. 

### Example of Using State 
```jsx
import React, {useState} from 'react'; 

function Counter() {
    // the first is the 'empty' variable
    // the second is the operation bind to the 'empty' variable space
    // 0 means the initial value of the state is value of 0 and also means it is an integer type 
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0); 
    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            
            // here we bind the operation of accumulate by 1 of the state type value 
            // it just like the listener that listens to the action of button's onClick 
            // once click happens, count +=1 and value will be updated to the local-global-value of the count in tyep of integer with init value of 0
            <button onClick={()=> setCount(count + 1)}></button>
        </div>
    ); 
}

```

In the example above, the `Counter` component uses the `useState` hook to manage the count state.
When the button is clicked, `setCount` updates the state, causing the component to re-render with the new count.
