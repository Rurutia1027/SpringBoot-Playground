# Spring Boot GraphQL 🚀

Welcome to the **Spring Boot GraphQL** project! This repository demonstrates how to integrate **GraphQL** into a Spring Boot application using **Gradle**. It covers essential aspects such as defining data models, using `@SchemaMapping` for controller mappings, and writing unit tests with GraphQL queries.

## 📦 Project Structure

- **Gradle Build Setup**: Uses Gradle to manage dependencies and build the project.
- **GraphQL Schema Definition**: Declares types and queries in `.graphqls` files.
- **Java Data Models**: Ensures type matching between GraphQL schema and Java classes.
- **Controller Layer Mapping**: Uses `@SchemaMapping` to bind queries to resolvers.
- **GraphQL Unit Testing**: Implements test cases using GraphQL annotations to validate queries and responses.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/spring-boot-graphql.git
cd spring-boot-graphql
```

### 2️⃣ Build and Run the Application
```sh
./gradlew bootRun
```

## 📌 Summary
