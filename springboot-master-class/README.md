# Spring Boot Master Class

## Overview

Learn how to get started with Spring Boot, a powerful framework for building web applications quickly and efficiently with minimal configuration. The Java-based programs built using Spring Boot "just run"‚Äîsimplifying development and deployment.

This course, taught by Nelson, is based on real-world software engineering experience and continuously updated with new material based on student feedback. By the end of this course, you will understand best practices for writing enterprise-grade applications using N-Tier Architecture and gain the skills needed to work on projects built with Spring Boot.
